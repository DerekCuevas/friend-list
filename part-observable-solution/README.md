# Part "observable" approach:
This solution takes advantage of redux's implementation of the 'observer pattern' and makes fetching results from the API (via dispatching the fetchFriends action) a side effect of updating the query.

Logic for dispatching these side effects are managed with redux's store.subscribe().

```javascript
store.subscribe((() => {
  let prevState = undefined;

  return () => {
    const state = store.getState();

    if (!prevState || (prevState.query !== state.query)) {
      store.dispatch(fetchFriends());
    }

    prevState = state;
  };
})());
```
(see - [index.js](index.js#L15))

Refer to \*/index.js and \*/containers/FriendSearchView.js for the difference in approach between this example, the [imperative-solution](../imperative-solution), and the [better-observable-solution](../better-observable-solution).

## To run
```sh
npm install
npm start
```

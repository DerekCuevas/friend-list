# Friend List - Motorcycle.js Solution

This is an example [Cycle.js](https://github.com/cyclejs) solution, but using
the [cycle-snabbdom](https://github.com/tylors/cycle-snabbdom) for rendering.
All side-effects take place in what we know as `drivers`, at the very edge of
our applications to keep our `main()` function pure. All functionality is out
of the box with the only exception of the 'fetch' driver to grab from the mock
API.

### To run
```shell
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
Open your browser to [http://localhost:3474](http://localhost:3474)

# Imperative approach:
Currently one of the most straightforward solutions. Logic for dispatching actions and reading router state is all contained in react components. The most "imperative" of the examples.

Refer to \*/index.js and \*/containers/FriendSearchView.js for the difference in approach between this example, the [better-observable-solution](../better-observable-solution), and the [part-observable-solution](../part-observable-solution).

## To run
```sh
npm install
npm start
```
